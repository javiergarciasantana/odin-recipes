  <h2>This incredibly easy and absolutely delicious Chicken Doner Kebab 
    recipe is sure to impress! It's made with thinly sliced yogurt marinated
    juicy chicken breast that is first charred to perfection and then wrapped
    up in a soft pita with some homemade garlicky lemon yogurt sauce, creamy 
    hummus, and all the fixings! </h2>
  
  <p>Let's talk about this recipe and why it's easy! First off, you don't need 
    a grill, spit, or any fancy equipment. In fact, you are going to be amazed 
    by this cooking technique. In a nutshell, you toss chicken breast in a boldly 
    spiced yogurt marinade, wrap it in plastic to form a log shape, freeze the log, 
    and then pan-fry thin slices of the marinated chicken. It's amazing and you are 
    not going to believe how authentic it tastes!

  <p>In some ways, this chicken doner kebab recipe is very similar to Greek Chicken 
    Gyros in that it's flavorful chicken wrapped up in a pita and served with a yogurt 
    sauce. Yet, instead of serving it with Tzatziki Sauce with cucumber like a gyro, 
    chicken doner kebab is served with a yogurt sauce that is seasoned with za'atar along 
    with lots of fresh garlic and lemon.

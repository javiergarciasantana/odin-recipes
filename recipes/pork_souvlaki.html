  <h1>Pork Souvlaki</h1>
  <img src="pork.jpeg" alt="WarmKebab">
  <h2>Pork souvlaki is a classic Greek dish consisting of grilled pork skewers
     that have been infused with a delicious garlicky, bright, and aromatic marinade. 
     Considered one of the most iconic Greek street foods, it is fortunately easy to 
     replicate at home!
  </h2>
  
  <p>Pork souvlaki is often one of the first introductions to Greek cuisine for visitors 
    from around the world.  In Greece, it's  usually served straight off the skewer with 
    a drizzle of lemon and a few pieces of grilled bread. Or, it's wrapped inside a warm 
    pita bread with several flavorful accompaniments, like Tzatziki and Greek Potatoes.

    Enjoying delicious pork souvlaki does not require a trip to Greece (or even a local 
    Greek restaurant). With just a few staple ingredients for a bold marinade and a lean 
    cut of pork, you can easily prepare this delicious and healthy dish at home!  
  </p>

  <p>Preparation time for the Greek pork souvlaki is minimal and it mostly revolves around 
    the flavorful marinade and cutting the pork tenderloin into bite-sized pieces. It's the 
    same technique used in Middle Eastern-style steak Shish Kabobs. While the meat marinates,
    all we have to do is assemble a few favorite fixings and we are ready for a feast.
